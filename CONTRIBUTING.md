### Add you name to the list of Contributors.md

- only modify one line in this file.

### How to Contribute
- contributions can be made to any documentation or they can be made in the index.js file. 
- if you are contributing to the documentation, then make sure that your pull request states so.
- if you are adding a feature to the index.js file, make sure that you place your feature in the list above.

### Adding a feature
- Feel free to come up with your own border colors and unique name. 
- To do this you can either modify one of the arrays with the colors you want or you can make a completely new array with more or less colors, acutal images, etc.. 
- However, make sure that you have three items in the array for it to currently work currently. So if you want only one frame, then copy it two extra times in the same array.
